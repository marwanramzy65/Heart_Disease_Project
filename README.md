# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction – Machine Learning & Streamlit Deployment

## 📌 Overview
This project builds a **machine learning pipeline** to predict the risk of heart disease based on patient medical data.  
It covers **data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, feature selection, model training, evaluation, and deployment** via Streamlit with Ngrok for public access.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains patient health metrics such as:

| Feature            | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| `age`              | Age in years |
| `sex`              | 0 = Female, 1 = Male |
| `cp`               | Chest pain type |
| `trestbps`         | Resting blood pressure (mm Hg) |
| `chol`             | Serum cholesterol (mg/dl) |
| `fbs`              | Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl |
| `restecg`          | Resting ECG results |
| `thalach`          | Maximum heart rate achieved |
| `exang`            | Exercise-induced angina |
| `oldpeak`          | ST depression induced by exercise |
| `slope`            | Slope of the peak exercise ST segment |
| `ca`               | Number of major vessels (0–3) colored by fluoroscopy |
| `thal`             | Thalassemia type |
| **Target**         | `1` = Heart disease, `0` = No disease |

## ⚙️ Project Workflow

### **1️⃣ Data Preprocessing**
- Load dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Handle missing values and clean data.
- Encode categorical features.
- Split data into **features (X)** and **target (y)**.
- Apply **StandardScaler** to normalize numerical features.

### **2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Visualize distributions using histograms and boxplots.
- Generate correlation heatmaps to detect relationships.
- Use count plots for categorical feature insights.

### **3️⃣ Feature Selection**
- **Random Forest Importance** → Identify key predictive features.
- **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)** → Iteratively remove less important features.

### **4️⃣ Dimensionality Reduction**
- Apply **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to reduce dimensionality while retaining most of the data variance.

### **5️⃣ Model Training & Evaluation**
Trained and compared the following algorithms:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- GradientBoosting

**Evaluation Metrics:**
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)

### **6️⃣ Model Saving**
- Export the final model as a `.joblib` file to reuse in the deployment phase.

### **7️⃣ Streamlit App Development**
- Built a web-based UI using Streamlit.
- Users enter medical details to receive **real-time predictions**.
- Displays results and explanations.

### **8️⃣ Ngrok Deployment**
- Ngrok creates a **public URL** for the Streamlit app.
- Steps:
  1. Install `pyngrok`
  2. Authenticate with your Ngrok token
  3. Run Streamlit locally
  4. Share public link generated by Ngrok
